# hello-world
Hello, My name is Melinda. I have enjoyed making this repository as it is for practising the GitHub Flow and refining my skillset (beginner-friendly). My 2024 resolution is to get my Data Analyst Associates at Ivy Tech-CC.
My family and I have created a cleaning company, I am excited to see how well we grow.
On the side, I am a Manager at McDonald's, it is a recent addition to my work experience. Sometimes,it is overwhelming but it is good work experience in customer relations and business structure. 
I enjoy my workteam as they help me grow both in the professional and personal development.
